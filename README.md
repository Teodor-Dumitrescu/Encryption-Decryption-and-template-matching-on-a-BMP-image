# Encryption-Decryption-and-template-matching-on-a-BMP-image
This is a project designed for my Procedural Programming course, written in C language, 
and it consists of receiving a BMP image which will be encrypted and decrypted, using a secret key. 
The program will then search the decrypted image for portions that resemble given patterns.

FOR THE INPUT_EXEMPLE:
The image that is going to be crypted and decrypted is peppers.bmp, and the image on which the template matching operation
will be run is test.bmp. You can also do both operations on test.bmp.
